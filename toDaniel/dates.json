Later that night, I did molly for the first time at the Above and Beyond concert. During a really difficult 30 minutes, you held me and reminisced about all the fun memories. I told you that I wanted to be with you forever and have your babies, but I made you promise that you'd forget everything I said."

You said it would take you two years to finish what you are doing with Hail, and then you don't want to be apart from me anymore. We rented Contact. I quickly fell asleep but woke up and had sex with you anyway."
